### Automated Garment Quality Assurance at Machine Speed

**Millimeter-precise garment measurements in 3 seconds — fully automated, fully auditable.**

## The Problem: Quality at Scale Is Broken

The global garment industry operates on **speed, volume, and razor-thin margins** — yet quality control remains largely **manual, slow, and incomplete**.

* Traditional garment measurement takes **30–60 seconds per piece**
* Human inspectors can only check **samples**, not every garment
* Manual readings are **error-prone, inconsistent, and subjective**
* QC data is fragmented, unverifiable, and often disputed between factory, buyer, and brand

In an industry producing **hundreds of billions of garments annually**, even a **1–2 mm deviation** can trigger:

* Buyer rejections
* Rework costs
* Shipment delays
* Lost trust and future orders

---

## The Reality: You Can’t Measure Everything — Until Now

Because traditional QC is slow, **100% inspection is economically impossible**.

That means:

* Defects escape detection
* Non-compliant pieces ship
* Brands absorb losses
* Factories lose credibility

This problem alone costs the garment industry **billions of dollars every year** in avoidable waste, rework, and disputes.

## The Argus Solution

### End-to-End Automated Measurement — In 3 Seconds

**Argus measures garments with millimeter-level precision in under 3 seconds per item.**

What used to take **30+ seconds manually** now happens:

* Automatically
* Consistently
* At production-line speed

This makes **100% garment measurement** finally possible — not just sampling.

## Why Argus Is Different

### 1. Precision Where It Matters Most: Measurements

Measurements are the **hardest problem in garment QC** — and we started there.

* Pixel-accurate AI models
* Geometry-aware measurement logic
* Camera-based non-contact inspection
* Reliable even at scale

Most systems avoid this complexity.
**Argus embraces it.**

---

### 2. Human Readings Are Error-Prone — Machines Are Not

Manual QC depends on:

* Fatigue
* Subjective judgment
* Inconsistent tape placement
* Environmental variation

Argus replaces this with:

* Deterministic measurement pipelines
* AI models trained for consistency
* Repeatable results across shifts, factories, and regions

**Same garment. Same result. Every time.**

---

### 3. Authentic, Tamper-Proof QC Data — Visible to Everyone

Argus generates **fully traceable, authentic QC data** that can be shared across the entire supply chain:

* Factory
* Buying house
* Brand
* Retailer

No more disputes.
No more “manual corrections.”
No more unverifiable reports.

**What the system measures is what everyone sees.**

---

## The Impact: Real Savings at Industrial Scale

The garment industry is valued at **$1.7+ trillion globally**, with massive production hubs across South and Southeast Asia — including Bangladesh, represented by organizations like Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.

With Argus:

* Faster inspection = higher throughput
* 100% inspection = fewer rejections
* Accurate QC = reduced rework
* Transparent data = stronger buyer trust

Even a **small reduction in defect leakage** translates into **millions of dollars saved annually** for mid-to-large manufacturers.

At scale, **this technology saves the industry hundreds of millions — if not billions — of dollars.**

## Built for What’s Next

### Today: Measurements

### Tomorrow: Full Visual Quality Intelligence

We’re starting with the **toughest technical challenge** — precise garment measurements.

Next, Argus expands into:

* Defect detection
* Part mismatch identification
* Stitch and seam analysis
* Fabric and cutting inconsistencies

All powered by:

* Advanced camera systems
* Cutting-edge computer vision
* A robust, production-grade backend engineered for factory environments

---

## Engineering That Scales With Production

Argus isn’t a lab prototype.

It’s built with:

* Industrial reliability
* High-throughput pipelines
* Secure data handling
* Scalable backend architecture

**Designed to run on real factory floors — not just demos.**

---

## The Future of Garment QC Is Automated

Quality control should be:

* Fast
* Accurate
* Transparent
* Scalable

**Argus makes that possible — today.**
